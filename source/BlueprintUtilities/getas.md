# GetAs system

!!!
The GetAs system is a simple overload of all the getter functions in Unreal Engine that allows you to specify the return class to avoid having to cast the result of the cast every time. All the provided getters are available in both pure (outside the execution thread) and impure (within the execution thread) versions. This page list all implemented getters.

## Accessibility

Every node of the GetAs system allows you to convert them between pure and impure mode in the context menu. As well as the purity option, all getters that take a target as input can switch between hard and soft pointer in the same context menu.

## Dynamic cast

The Dynamic Cast node works just like the native CastTo node in Unreal Engine, with the difference being that it allows you to change the target class without having to replace the node. It's simple and effective.
